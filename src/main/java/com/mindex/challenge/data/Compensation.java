*
* @Id to let jpa know which is the unique key.
* String compensationId: it is taken as string because ids can be varchar
*
* Employee employee
*
* double Salary: Salary is taken as double instead of integers just in case if someone has a fractional salary
*
* Date effDate: I have used @JsonFormat which is really helpful to maintain a particular format for the effective date
*
* @Version: Added version to achieve multiple threads. It introduces optimistic locking concept and makes sure updates are only applied to documents with matching version.
* Therefore, the actual value of the version property is added to the update query in a way that the update wonâ€™t have any effect if another operation altered the document in between.
